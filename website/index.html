  <h4>Guitarists need to ensure that their instrument is in tune before jamming out. Our goal is to make this process easy-to-use for every body, regardless of skill level on the guitar. Beginners will love the ease of use, whereas adept players will love the speed and consistency of the device.
     Our device is tailored towards beginner users, however, as keeping your instrument in tune consistently is quite tedious, so it may be easier for the user to simply have a device tune their guitar for them. At the same time, we also aim to include advanced players in our target audience.
     This is done due to how our group plans on implementing further functionality to include other alternative tunings, such as Drop C or Drop D. Because these tuning configurations are less widely-used, getting into these tunings is made easier due to the device automatically doing it for the user.
  </p>
  <p>
     The Guitar Auto Tuner itself works by connecting to the user's smartphone via Bluetooth. The user's smartphone actually acts as a controller and display for the device, as it allows for the user to select which string they're using and to tune it. This also notifies the user of what the pitch is.
     The app then sends a signal to the device to rotate in a specific direction, after reading in a sample of 1000 frequency recordings and comparing the mode of that set to the theoretical frequency for each string, and signals to the device which direction to turn the motor.
