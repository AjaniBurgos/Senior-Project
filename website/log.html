    <li>The official Guitar Auto Tuner website is born!</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Hosted on the CSE domain of UNR.</li>
      <li>Created different pages for the information neccessary</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Will be using placeholders for future additions (i.e. project video)</li>

  <b>29 January 2019: </b>
  <ul>
      <li>Second demo occured with Devrin at 10AM in the MIKC, some of the things mentioned are:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Need to meet more frequently, keep working on progress</li>
        <li>May need to upgrade the embedded system from an Arduino Uno to an Arduino Duo/Raspberry Pi</li>
        <li>May need to consider upgrading the torque of the motor when turning the actual peg</li>
        <li>Still need to clean up the accuracy of the frequency readings to match the frequencies being projected</li>
        <li>Need to clean up the mobile app, create a more robust user interface</li>
        <li>Need to create a single unit, hide the cabling</li>
        <li>May need to create a request on Innovations Day for a quieter space (VR Area?), maybe include sound compression padding</li>

  <b>22 February 2019:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Reiterated on resources used, use cases, and functional/nonfunctional requirements</li>
  </ul>

  <b>8 March 2019:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Changed Technology used for mobile application</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Xamarin-->Android Studio</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of support for working with Bluetooth, one of our primary technologies</li>
        <li>User interface much more polished compared to previous iteration: </li>

          <li>Ensure proper motor torque, but not fast enough to break a string/damage the tuning knob</li>
          <li>Implement a safety system that detects that the string is getting too tight based on a high frequency for the string being tuned</li>
        </ul>

  <b>13 March 2019:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Presented our progress to Devrin Lee & Connor Scully-Allison</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Updated them on technology update</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Demonstrated latest iteration of the mobile app</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Demonstrated ability to send necessary information over Bluetooth from the phone to the device</li>
      <li>Demonstrated that the motor's torque was sufficient enough to turn the tuning knob</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <b>4 April 2019:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Presented our project to the rest of the class</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Showed off general functionality of the project itself</li>
      <li>Showed off the hardware and technologies that we're using</li>
      <li>Demonstrated connectivity from the device to the smartphone</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <b>19 April 2019:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Changed general design of the device, decided to use the smartphone's microphone over the extra microphone we were originally using</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The frequency readings were inaccurate prior to this change. This was due to the microphone being used being of low quality.</li>
      <li>We found the frequency readings from the microphone were <i>much</i> more precise compared to before.</li>
      <li>Currently finishing up fine-tuning the logic necessary to turn the tuning peg before Innovations Day</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Not as <i>automatic</i> as we'd like it to be, as it still requires much more user input than necessary.</li>
        <li>But the project is in a much better state than it was prior to presentation.</li>
        <li>Of course, this leaves us plenty of room for future development in delivering a more polished final product.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <b>22 April 2019:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>After finishing up with the main functionality of the device itself, we decided not to solder the components together</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This was after assessing the amount of risk with our lack of soldering experience and the remaining time left before Innovations Day.</li>
      <li>Didn't want to risk destroying our breadboard and wait for another shipment before Innovations Day.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Began filming the video that will be displayed on our website.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>We plan on going over the device's functionality, how it works with the mobile app, and a demonstration with narration throughout of how it's supposed to work.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <b>30 April 2019:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrated our project to Devrin Lee & Connor Scully-Allison</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Discussed our change in design, updates to user interface & design on the mobile app, and received feedback about our project</li>
      <ul>
        <li>UI and design Updates were well received, didn't really have to worry about anything else prior to Innovations Day</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <b>3 May 2019:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Innovations Day has come...</li>
    <ul>
      <li>We plan on all being there throughout the time allotted to demonstrate our project.</li>
      <li>Needless to say, we demonstrated the general functionality of the device itself with passerbys</li>
      <ul>
        <li>It was very well-received, the smaller room helped with noise enough to tune treble strings but not as reliably as desired for bass strings</li>
        <li>Some visitors mentioned that the project was very cool and unique, and others pointed out some counterarguments for why they would want to use our device, their arguments were:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Tuning by ear is something developed over time and some users may end up relying on the device</li>
          <li>The device is still not as fast as tuning by hand</li>
        </ul>
        <li>All-in-all though, the project was a success!</li>
        <li>Now we're just finalizing everything and uploading everything necessary for submission</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
